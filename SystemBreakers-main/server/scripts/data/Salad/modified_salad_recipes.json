When the nuts have cooled, place them in a plastic bag and whack them with the flat side of a broad knife (please don’t smack them with a ceramic knife – you will be sad) or under a rolling pin or cutting board. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar and the balsamic vinegar until the sugar is dissolved. While whisking continuously, slowly drizzle the oil into the vinegar-sugar mixture in a steady and thin stream. You should have an emulsified dressing. Place strawberries and greens in a large mixing bowl. Pour the dressing over the salad and season with salt and pepper. Toss. Sprinkle the crushed hazelnuts over the salad and serve.
