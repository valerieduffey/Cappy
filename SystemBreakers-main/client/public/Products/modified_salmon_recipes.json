Set over medium heat and bring poaching liquid to 170°F (77°C), using an instant-read thermometer if you have one; otherwise, bring liquid to just below a bare simmer. Adjusting heat to maintain water temperature, cook until salmon flakes easily when pressed, about 6 minutes. Drain, discard aromatics, and transfer salmon to a mixing bowl. Using your fingers, shred salmon roughly.",

Add mayonnaise, chives, remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice, coriander seeds, and cayenne. Season with salt and pepper. Stir well until ingredients are thoroughly mixed and salmon is more finely shredded.",

Press plastic against the surface and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours. Serve with toasts or crackers.

      "Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a glass baking dish with aluminum foil. Lay the salmon in the baking dish, skin side down. Coat with olive oil. Liberally season salmon fillet with kosher salt. Pour chardonnay and water over the fish. Cover pan with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes. To see if the salmon is fully cooked, cut into the fillet. If the flesh flakes and the color is opaque, then it’s done.",
      "Transfer the salmon fillet (without the poaching liquid) to a platter. Cover and place in the refrigerator until it’s completely cooled.",
      "When the salmon has cooled, in a separate bowl, whisk together crème fraîche, lemon juice and chopped chives. Add the poached salmon to the bowl and smash to combine. Do not overdo it, though, as you don't want the salmon to turn pasty. Mix in the smoked salmon and, if necessary, season with salt and white pepper.",
      "Serve."
