You want it to sizzle and brown on one side. Scoop as many steak bites as you can with your spatula and flip them over. Repeat until all the meat is turned.

As a rough guide, each steak will take 3 mins in total for rare, 4-5 mins in total for medium and 7-8 mins for well done. If you have a digital cooking thermometer, the middle of the steak should be 50C for rare, 60C for medium and 70C for well done. If your steak has a thick layer of fat running down the side, hold the steak on its side with a pair of tongs and push the fat into the pan for 2 mins or until golden brown.",
