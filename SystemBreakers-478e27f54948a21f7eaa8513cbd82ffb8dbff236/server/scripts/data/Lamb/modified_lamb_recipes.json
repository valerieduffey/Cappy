      "In a small bowl, mix the rosemary, salt, pepper, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil together. Coat the lamb chops with the mixture, massaging it into the meat with your fingers. If you are working with double rib chops, cover and let stand at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes. If you are working with single rib chops, and you want the result to be rare, let the chops sit in the rub in the refrigerator—do not let come to room temp or the thin ribs will easily overcook when you sear them in the next step. You can also marinate the chops in the fridge for up to 24 hours. (Allow double rib chops to stand at room temperature 30 to 40 minutes before cooking.)",
      "Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in an oven-proof sauté pan over high heat. When the oil is shimmering hot, sear the chops. Sear double rib chops on all sides about 2 to 3 minutes per side. If you are working with single rib chops, sear only on two sides, and only a minute (or less) on each side if you want the result to be rare or medium rare.",
      "At this point, if you want your lamb chops rare, they are likely cooked enough. If you would like your chops more cooked, you can put them in a 400°F oven for 3 to 5 minutes, or keep them in the hot pan, lower the heat to warm, and cover the pan for a few minutes. Note that rib chops are so small, and cook so quickly, checking for internal temperature with a thermometer can be impractical. For this reason I use the finger test to check the doneness of the chops. That said, if you have an instant-read thermometer and want to check thick chops, aim for 125°F for rare, 135°F medium-rare, and 140°F for medium.",

(Alternatively, place chickpeas in a large saucepan and cover with 3 inches cold water. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Let stand for 1 hour.) Drain.",
      "Heat 2 teaspoons oil in 4-quart or larger pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add onion and carrots; cook, stirring, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, coriander and cayenne; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Remove from the heat.",
      "Sprinkle lamb shank with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in a medium skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium heat. Add the lamb shank and cook, turning from time to time, until browned all over, 3 to 7 minutes. Transfer to the pressure cooker. Add broth, tomatoes, bay leaves and the chickpeas.",
      "Secure the pressure cooker lid. Bring to high pressure over high heat following manufacturer's directions. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting that maintains high pressure. Cook for 35 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, place bulgur in a medium bowl. Cover with boiling water and let stand for 15 minutes. Drain in a sieve, pressing out excess water.",
      "Let the pressure release naturally. This will take 5 to 20 minutes.",
      "To prepare pesto: Meanwhile, process mint, pistachios and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. With the motor running, gradually add oil, lemon juice and yogurt through the feed tube. Process until the mixture forms a paste. If using unsalted pistachios, add salt, if desired.",
      "When the pressure has released, discard bay leaves. Skim fat from the surface of the soup. Using tongs, transfer the lamb shank to a clean cutting board. When cool enough to handle, coarsely shred the lamb meat and return it to the soup. Add the drained bulgur. Heat through. Stir in lemon juice. Dollop some pesto onto each serving."
